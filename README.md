<h1>Investigative Plan of Action</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>As more companies store information electronically, there is an increased need for digital forensics to discover the trails of illegal or malicious acts. In this task, I used the scenario to develop an investigative plan of action that will prepare my investigative team to conduct an analysis on the gathered evidence.</p>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<p>An oil company’s senior management has reason to suspect that John Smith, one of the company’s mechanical engineers, allegedly took information that was clearly identified as proprietary. The company’s legal office has requested digital evidence regarding the potential violation of company policy, which prohibits the sharing of proprietary information without prior approval. The employee was not authorized to access proprietary information. All employees sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and acceptable use policies (AUPs). Senior management and the legal office have approved the request for digital evidence.</p>

<p>I am a member of the investigative team asked to develop an investigative action plan.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In an era where digital data is integral to organizational operations, safeguarding proprietary information is paramount. The oil company is confronting a potential breach of its policies due to the alleged unauthorized access and sharing of proprietary information by John Smith, a mechanical engineer. As investigative team members, we must develop a comprehensive plan of action adhering to forensic best practices and standards (NIST, 2006). This plan aims to maximize evidence collection while minimizing the impact on the organization, ensuring a thorough and lawful investigation.</p>

<h2>Strategy to Maximize Evidence Collection and Minimize Organizational Impact</h2>

<p>Our strategy involves a discreet and efficient approach to gathering necessary evidence while maintaining normal business operations. Legal compliance and authorization are our priorities; we will obtain all requisite legal approvals and ensure adherence to relevant laws and company policies, including respecting employee privacy rights. By conducting the investigation confidentiality, we aim to prevent alerting the suspect and risking evidence tampering or destruction. Focusing on specific systems and devices John Smith uses—such as his workstation, email accounts, and network access logs—will streamline the investigation. We will employ forensic imaging to create exact replicas of digital media, allowing analysis without altering the original data. Collaborating closely with the IT department will help us understand system configurations and minimize disruptions during evidence collection.</p>

<h2>Tools and Techniques for Evidence Gathering, Preparation, and Analysis</h2>

<p>Our team will utilize industry-standard tools and methodologies to ensure integrity and reliability. For evidence gathering, we will use write-blockers to prevent alteration of data during acquisition and forensic imaging software like EnCase Forensic or FTK Imager for bit-by-bit copies of digital media. In preparing the evidence, maintaining a chain of custody documentation is crucial; we will keep detailed records of evidence handling and use secure storage solutions such as tamper-evident packaging and safe facilities. We will employ techniques like file system examination to analyze file structures, metadata, and timestamps. Keyword searches will help us implement targeted searches for proprietary terms, and we will examine emails and communications for unauthorized disclosures.</p>

<h2>Collection and Preservation of Evidence Using Standardized Procedures</h2>

<p>We will adhere to standardized procedures outlined in ISO/IEC 27037:2012 to preserve evidence integrity. Forensic imaging will be used to create exact duplicates of relevant digital media without altering the original data. Hash verification methods like MD5 or SHA-1 will ensure data integrity by verifying that copies are exact replicas. Maintaining a meticulous chain of custody is essential; every step of evidence handling will be documented thoroughly. Secure evidence storage in controlled environments with limited access will further protect the evidence from tampering or loss.</p>

<h2>Examination of Seized Evidence Related to the Suspected Violation</h2>

<p>Our examination will focus on identifying evidence pertinent to the alleged violation. Data analysis will involve reviewing access logs to check for unauthorized access to proprietary
files and examining metadata to investigate file properties for signs of data exfiltration. Communication analysis will include scrutinizing emails for suspicious communications or attachments and analyzing logs using USB drives or other removable media. We will also use specialized software to recover potentially deleted proprietary information, ensuring a comprehensive examination of all relevant data.</p>

<h2>Approach to Drawing Conclusions Based on Digital Evidence</h2>

<p>To draw accurate conclusions, we will correlate findings by cross-referencing data from various sources to establish a coherent narrative. Maintaining objectivity is crucial; we will base our decisions solely on factual evidence without bias. Engaging forensic experts will help interpret complex data findings, ensuring that our conclusions are supported by professional analysis. Detailed documentation of methodologies and findings will be provided to support our conclusions, enhancing the credibility and reliability of our report.</p>

<h2>Presentation of Case Details and Conclusions to Senior Management</h2>

<p>We will present our findings professionally and comprehensively to senior management. An executive summary will concisely overview the investigation and critical findings. Detailed
reporting will include in-depth analysis, evidence charts, and timelines to provide transparency. Visual aids such as graphs and diagrams illustrate data relationships and conclusions, making complex information more accessible. We will also offer recommendations, suggesting actionable policy improvements and risk mitigation steps. Ensuring the presentation aligns with legal standards is essential to protect the company and support any potential legal actions.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The investigative plan outlined is designed to address the suspected policy violation effectively while upholding forensic best practices. Our team aims to provide senior management with clear and actionable insights by meticulously collecting, preserving, and analyzing digital evidence. This approach seeks to resolve the current issue and reinforces the company's commitment to protecting its proprietary information and maintaining robust security protocols.</p>
